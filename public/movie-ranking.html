<h1>The Best Movies according to Vidya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies from all-time (that I can remember now).</h2>

<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>To fly its all I wanted in that time... And The song "Take my breath alway" was a historical mark in my student time and friends.</p>

<h3>Karate Kid III</h3>
<p>Beautiful scenes of Okinawa and mistery of Japan. And the song "The glory of Love".</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Just for dreamming... the time has stopped for some weeks. And the song "My heart will go on".</p>

<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Opened my eyes to this unreal world we live.</p>
